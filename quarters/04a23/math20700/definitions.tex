\begin{definition} {Convergence on metric space}
    Let $(M, d)$ be a metric space. Sequence $(p_n) \in M$ converges to $p \in M$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \in \bbn$ such that $\forall n \geq N, d(p_n, p) < \epsilon$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} {Continuous map between metric spaces}
    Let $M, N$ be metric spaces. $f: M \to N$ is continuous if it preserves sequential convergence. i.e., if sequence $p_n \to p$ in $M$, then sequence $f(p_n) \to f(p)$ in $N$.

    This condition is equivalent to standard $\epsilon, \delta$ definition of continuity, that is:

    $f: M \to N$ is continuous iff $\forall \epsilon > 0, \forall p \in M, \exists \delta = \delta(\epsilon, p)$ such that $d(p, x) < \delta \implies d(fp, fx) < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} {Continuous map between topological spaces}
    $f: M \to N$. $f$ is continuous if the preimage of each closed set in $N$ is closed in $M$, or equivalently, the preimage of each open set in $N$ is closed in $M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} {Homeomorphism - the Isomorphism of Metric Spaces}
Let $M, N$ be metric spaces. $f: M \to N$ is a homeomorphism if it is bijective, continuous and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also continuous. Write $M \cong N$.
\end{definition}
